qbot is the bot used by the [unofficial Arch Linux community][1] on Discord.
Originally its only function was to manage support channels, but it has evolved
to do much more.

Modules:
- `admin` lets server owners administer and configure the bot.
- `arch` contains commands for searching the Arch wiki, repositories, and AUR.
- `blacklist` can automatically delete messages matching configurable regexes.
- `colors` generates, manages, and assigns color roles.
- `figlet` converts text to ASCII art.
- `help` provides a help command that displays information about commands.
- `queries` helps manage support channels using a database of support questions.
- `snippets` lets users invoke configurable text snippets.
- `quotes` lets users grab quotes from users and reference them.
- `util` provides simple utility commands.
- `xkcd` allows searching and posting XKCD comics.

## Running your own instance of qbot

### Preferred method

This repository is a [Nix flake].

On NixOS, you can run your own instance of the bot by importing
`github:arch-community/qbot`, adding the `nixosModule` output and the overlay
to your configuration, and configuring the option `services.qbot` as defined
in `module.nix`.

### Setting up your own environment

#### With Nix

Clone this Git repository and enter its directory.

Run `nix-build ./default.nix`. The resulting executable is at `result/bin/qbot`.

#### Otherwise

Install Ruby, at least version 3.1 (higher versions untested). Install bundler.

Clone this Git repository. Enter the directory. Run `bundle install` to set up
the environment.

To start the bot, run `bundle exec qbot`.

### Run the bot

qbot is configured in a YAML file at `config/global.yml`. Copy the example
config to `config/global.yml` and add the correct settings for your instance.

Start the bot.

qbot uses an SQLite database to store per-server configuration and user data.
To initialize the database, let qbot fully start up, then enter `irb` into the
bot CLI to enter the irb console. In this mode, run `Database.define_schema`.
Press Ctrl+D to exit and type `rs` to restart the bot.

### Administration

Bot CLI:

- `rs` or `restart` restarts the bot.
- `rc` or `reload-config` reloads the config.
- `lm` or `load-module` loads or reloads a module.
- `irb` opens a REPL in the context of the bot.
- `quit` or `stop` stops the bot.
